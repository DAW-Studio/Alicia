    <p>Dear Alicia,<br>This is not a hand-written letter, the letter you deserve, it is however still written by me and in a font that looks far better than my rushed hand writing. I am sure you would still love and appreciate a hand-writen letter from me, of which I will still present. But, for the moment, until my hand learns to brush fine letters, I give you this letter written in basic html. Each morning I write you something small saying something sweet and knowing how much that means to you and how happy it makes you, I will keep doing that forever. However, I have always wanted to write you a love letter, this is that. I hope you like it.</p>
